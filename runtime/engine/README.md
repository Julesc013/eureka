# Engine

`runtime/engine/` is the home for engine behavior and its declared dependency boundaries.

Boundary notes:

- engine must not depend on `surfaces/*`
- engine owns runtime behavior, not surface presentation
- `interfaces/public/` and `interfaces/service/` are the only engine-facing paths that gateway may consume
- `interfaces/ingest/`, `interfaces/extract/`, and `interfaces/normalize/` are the only engine-facing paths that connectors may consume
- `sdk/` is reserved for a future narrow offline boundary and is intentionally empty
- these interface paths are concrete and advisory today; enforcement tooling is still deferred
