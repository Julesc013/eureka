# Gateway

`runtime/gateway/` is the runtime implementation area for gateway behavior.

Boundary notes:

- gateway depends on governed contracts plus `runtime/engine/interfaces/public/**` and `runtime/engine/interfaces/service/**`
- gateway public product contracts live under `contracts/gateway/public_api`
- the `public_api/` directory here is for runtime implementation support, not for canonical contract definition
