# Source Cache Contract v0

Source Cache Contract v0 defines future public-safe source metadata summaries. The source cache is not live connector runtime, not arbitrary URL cache, not a raw payload store, not a private data store, not an executable payload store, and not production persistence in P70.

Source cache records preserve source refs, cache identity, cache kind, source policy, acquisition context, payload summary, normalized metadata, freshness, provenance, fixity, privacy, rights/risk, and hard no-runtime/no-mutation guarantees. Runtime source cache is contract-only and not implemented.

Future live source cache entries require approved source sync workers, source policy review, rate limits, timeouts, circuit breakers, descriptive User-Agent policy, source terms review, cache-first handling, and evidence attribution. Public queries must not fan out live to source cache writes.

Source cache records may feed the future evidence ledger, candidate index, public index builder, or master index review queue only after validation, review, promotion policy, and contract-specific runtime work. P70 performs no source cache mutation, evidence ledger mutation, candidate mutation, public/local/master index mutation, telemetry, credentials, downloads, installs, execution, or external calls.

## P71 Internet Archive Metadata Connector Approval

`docs/reference/INTERNET_ARCHIVE_METADATA_CONNECTOR_APPROVAL.md` defines an approval-only, metadata-only future Internet Archive connector pack. It is not runtime, makes no external calls, enables no public-query fanout, performs no downloads/file retrieval/mirroring, and mutates no source cache, evidence ledger, candidate index, public/local/master index, telemetry, or credentials. Future work is blocked on official source policy review, User-Agent/contact policy, rate limits, timeouts, retry/backoff, circuit breakers, cache-first source cache output, and evidence ledger attribution.

This cross-reference keeps `docs/reference/SOURCE_CACHE_CONTRACT.md` aligned with the source-ingestion boundary: IA metadata may become future reviewed cache/evidence input, never direct truth or live public search fanout.

## P72 Wayback/CDX/Memento Connector Approval Pack v0

P72 defines a future availability/capture-metadata-only Wayback/CDX/Memento connector approval pack. The connector is not implemented, no external calls are made, public queries do not fan out to Wayback/CDX/Memento, arbitrary URL fetch is forbidden, archived content fetch/capture replay/WARC download are forbidden, and future outputs must be cache-first/evidence-first after URI privacy review and approval.

<!-- P73-GITHUB-RELEASES-CONNECTOR-APPROVAL-START -->
## P73 GitHub Releases Connector Approval Pack v0

P73 defines a future release-metadata-only GitHub Releases connector approval pack. The live connector is not implemented, no external calls are made, no GitHub API calls are made, public queries do not fan out to GitHub, arbitrary repository fetch is forbidden, repository clone is forbidden, release asset download is forbidden, source archive download is forbidden, raw file/blob/tree fetch is forbidden, scraping/crawling is forbidden, token use is not allowed now, and future outputs must be cache-first/evidence-first after repository identity review and approval.

<!-- P74-PYPI-METADATA-CONNECTOR-APPROVAL-START -->
## P74 PyPI Metadata Connector Approval Pack v0

P74 adds an approval-only, package metadata-only PyPI connector pack. It adds no live PyPI connector runtime, no external calls, no PyPI API calls, no package metadata fetch, no release fetch, no wheel/sdist/package file download, no package install, no dependency resolution, no package archive inspection, no public-query fanout, no telemetry, no credentials or tokens, and no source cache/evidence ledger/candidate/index mutation. Package identity review, dependency metadata caution, source policy review, User-Agent/contact, token policy, rate limits, timeouts, retry/backoff, circuit breaker, cache-first output, and evidence attribution remain approval gates.

<!-- P75-NPM-METADATA-SUMMARY-START -->
## P75 npm Metadata Connector Approval Pack v0

Completed as an approval-only package metadata connector pack. It adds no live npm connector runtime, no external calls, no npm registry API calls, no npm/yarn/pnpm CLI calls, no package metadata fetch, no version fetch, no dist-tag fetch, no tarball metadata fetch, no tarball download, no package file download, no package install, no dependency resolution, no package archive inspection, no lifecycle script execution, no npm audit, no public-query fanout, no telemetry, no credentials or tokens, and no source cache/evidence ledger/candidate/index mutation. It requires package identity review, scoped package review, dependency metadata caution, lifecycle script risk policy, source policy review, User-Agent/contact decisions, and cache-first evidence outputs. Next recommended branch: P76 Software Heritage Connector Approval Pack v0.

<!-- P76-SOFTWARE-HERITAGE-SUMMARY-START -->
## P76 Software Heritage Connector Approval Pack v0

Completed as an approval-only software identity/archive metadata connector pack. It adds no live Software Heritage connector runtime, no external calls, no Software Heritage API calls, no SWHID resolution, no origin/visit/snapshot/release/revision/directory/content lookup, no source code download, no repository clone, no source archive download, no source file retrieval, no public-query fanout, no telemetry, no credentials or tokens, and no source cache/evidence ledger/candidate/index mutation. It requires SWHID/origin/repository identity review, source-code-content risk policy, source policy review, User-Agent/contact decisions, and cache-first evidence outputs. Next recommended branch: P77 Public Hosted Deployment Evidence v0.

<!-- P79-OBJECT-PAGE-CONTRACT-START -->
## P79 Object Page Contract v0

Object Page Contract v0 is contract-only and evidence-first. It defines future public object pages that preserve provisional identity, source/evidence/provenance, compatibility, conflicts, scoped absence, and gaps without implementing runtime object pages.

Boundary notes:

- No runtime object routes, database, persistent object-page store, source connector runtime, source cache runtime, evidence ledger runtime, candidate promotion, public-index mutation, local-index mutation, master-index mutation, live source fanout, downloads, installs, execution, uploads, telemetry, accounts, rights clearance, or malware safety claim are added.
- Public search may reference object page links only after a future governed integration; P79 does not mutate public search result cards or the public index.
- Object pages are not app-store, downloader, installer, or execution surfaces.
