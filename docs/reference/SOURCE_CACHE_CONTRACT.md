# Source Cache Contract v0

Source Cache Contract v0 defines future public-safe source metadata summaries. The source cache is not live connector runtime, not arbitrary URL cache, not a raw payload store, not a private data store, not an executable payload store, and not production persistence in P70.

Source cache records preserve source refs, cache identity, cache kind, source policy, acquisition context, payload summary, normalized metadata, freshness, provenance, fixity, privacy, rights/risk, and hard no-runtime/no-mutation guarantees. Runtime source cache is contract-only and not implemented.

Future live source cache entries require approved source sync workers, source policy review, rate limits, timeouts, circuit breakers, descriptive User-Agent policy, source terms review, cache-first handling, and evidence attribution. Public queries must not fan out live to source cache writes.

Source cache records may feed the future evidence ledger, candidate index, public index builder, or master index review queue only after validation, review, promotion policy, and contract-specific runtime work. P70 performs no source cache mutation, evidence ledger mutation, candidate mutation, public/local/master index mutation, telemetry, credentials, downloads, installs, execution, or external calls.

<!-- P71-INTERNET-ARCHIVE-METADATA-CONNECTOR-APPROVAL-START -->
## P71 Internet Archive Metadata Connector Approval

`docs/reference/INTERNET_ARCHIVE_METADATA_CONNECTOR_APPROVAL.md` defines an approval-only, metadata-only future Internet Archive connector pack. It is not runtime, makes no external calls, enables no public-query fanout, performs no downloads/file retrieval/mirroring, and mutates no source cache, evidence ledger, candidate index, public/local/master index, telemetry, or credentials. Future work is blocked on official source policy review, User-Agent/contact policy, rate limits, timeouts, retry/backoff, circuit breakers, cache-first source cache output, and evidence ledger attribution.

This cross-reference keeps `docs/reference/SOURCE_CACHE_CONTRACT.md` aligned with the source-ingestion boundary: IA metadata may become future reviewed cache/evidence input, never direct truth or live public search fanout.

## P72 Wayback/CDX/Memento Connector Approval Pack v0

P72 defines a future availability/capture-metadata-only Wayback/CDX/Memento connector approval pack. The connector is not implemented, no external calls are made, public queries do not fan out to Wayback/CDX/Memento, arbitrary URL fetch is forbidden, archived content fetch/capture replay/WARC download are forbidden, and future outputs must be cache-first/evidence-first after URI privacy review and approval.

## P79 Object Page Contract v0

Object Page Contract v0 is contract-only and evidence-first. It defines future public object pages that preserve provisional identity, source/evidence/provenance, compatibility, conflicts, scoped absence, and gaps without implementing runtime object pages.

Boundary notes:

- No runtime object routes, database, persistent object-page store, source connector runtime, source cache runtime, evidence ledger runtime, candidate promotion, public-index mutation, local-index mutation, master-index mutation, live source fanout, downloads, installs, execution, uploads, telemetry, accounts, rights clearance, or malware safety claim are added.
- Public search may reference object page links only after a future governed integration; P79 does not mutate public search result cards or the public index.
- Object pages are not app-store, downloader, installer, or execution surfaces.
<!-- P79-OBJECT-PAGE-CONTRACT-END -->

<!-- P80-SOURCE-PAGE-CONTRACT-START -->
## P80 Source Page Contract v0

Source Page Contract v0 is contract-only and evidence-first. It defines future public source pages for source identity, status, coverage, connector posture, source policy gates, source cache/evidence posture, public search projection, query-intelligence projection, limitations, provenance caution, and rights/risk posture.

Boundary notes:

- No runtime source routes, database, persistent source-page store, connector runtime, source sync runtime, source cache runtime, evidence ledger runtime, candidate promotion, public-index mutation, local-index mutation, master-index mutation, live source fanout, downloads, mirrors, installs, execution, uploads, telemetry, accounts, rights clearance, malware safety claim, or authoritative source trust claim are added.
- Public search may reference source page links or source badges only after a future governed integration; P80 does not mutate public search result cards or the public index.
- Source pages explain source posture and limitations; they are not source API proxies, scrapers, crawlers, download pages, mirrors, or connector health dashboards.

<!-- P81-COMPARISON-PAGE-CONTRACT-START -->
## P81 Comparison Page Contract v0

Comparison Page Contract v0 is contract-only and evidence-first. It defines future public comparison pages for subjects, criteria, matrices, identity/version/representation/source/evidence/compatibility/action comparisons, conflict preservation, scoped gaps, and future result-card/object/source projections.

<!-- P81-COMPARISON-PAGE-CONTRACT-END -->

<!-- P82-CROSS-SOURCE-IDENTITY-RESOLUTION-START -->
## P82 Cross-Source Identity Resolution Contract v0

Cross-Source Identity Resolution Contract v0 is contract-only and evidence-first. It defines future identity relation assessments and provisional clusters for exact, likely, possible, variant, version, release, representation, member, package, repository, capture, alias, near-match, different, conflicting, and unknown relations.

Boundary notes:

- No runtime identity resolver, persistent identity store, cluster runtime, merge runtime, destructive deduplication, records merged, candidate promotion, master-index mutation, public-index mutation, source-cache mutation, evidence-ledger mutation, candidate-index mutation, live source fanout, downloads, installs, execution, telemetry, accounts, source trust, rights clearance, malware safety claim, or identity truth overclaim are added.
- Public search, object pages, source pages, and comparison pages may reference identity relation labels only after future governed integration; P82 does not mutate public search or public index.
- Identity confidence is not identity truth; names and aliases alone are weak evidence; conflicts are preserved.
<!-- P82-CROSS-SOURCE-IDENTITY-RESOLUTION-END -->

<!-- P83-RESULT-MERGE-DEDUPLICATION-START -->
## P83 Result Merge and Deduplication Contract v0

P83 defines contract-only search-result grouping and deduplication semantics. It preserves alternatives, conflicts, source/evidence/provenance refs, and user-visible explanations while forbidding runtime grouping, result suppression, ranking changes, destructive merge, candidate promotion, live source calls, telemetry, and index/cache/ledger mutation.

Future public search, object/source/comparison pages, cross-source identity resolution, and ranking contracts may reference P83 only after governed runtime planning.
