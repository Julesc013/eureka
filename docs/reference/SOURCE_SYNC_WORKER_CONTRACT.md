# Source Sync Worker Contract v0

Source Sync Worker Contract v0 defines future source sync worker job and manifest records. A source sync worker is not connector runtime yet. It is not a crawler/scraper, not public-query fanout, not source cache/evidence ledger mutation in v0, not candidate index mutation, and not master-index mutation.

## Job Shape

`contracts/source_sync/source_sync_worker_job.v0.json` records job identity, job kind taxonomy, source target, source policy, approval gates, scheduling, retry/timeout/rate-limit/circuit-breaker policy, User-Agent and source terms policy, input refs, expected outputs, safety requirements, privacy, rights/risk, limitations, and hard no-execution/no-mutation guarantees.

## Future Worker Manifest

`contracts/source_sync/source_sync_worker_manifest.v0.json` describes a future worker family, supported job kinds, allowed source families, defaults, required approvals, safety defaults, output policy, and no-runtime guarantees. Runtime is not implemented.

## Source Policy And Approval

Live source sync requires approval and source policy review. Future live jobs require source policy, rate limit, User-Agent, circuit breaker, cache policy, evidence output, rights/risk, and connector contract review before any source access.

## Scheduling And Limits

Scheduling is not created in P69. Future workers must define bounded schedules, retry backoff, timeouts, per-source rate limits, and circuit breakers before execution.

## Cache-First And Evidence Attribution

Expected outputs are future-only. Source sync workers must feed source cache and evidence ledger later, with validation and review, before any public use or candidate promotion. They must not mutate the master index directly.

## Relations

Probe queue and demand dashboard records may suggest future source sync work, but P69 does not enqueue jobs or wire public search to source fanout. Candidate index and promotion policy remain review-gated future consumers only.

## P70 Source Cache And Evidence Ledger Relationship

Source Cache Contract v0 and Evidence Ledger Contract v0 define future output destinations for approved source sync workers. P70 remains contract-only: no worker writes source cache or evidence ledger records, no live source call occurs, and no candidate/public/local/master index mutation occurs.

## P71 Internet Archive Metadata Connector Approval

`docs/reference/INTERNET_ARCHIVE_METADATA_CONNECTOR_APPROVAL.md` defines an approval-only, metadata-only future Internet Archive connector pack. It is not runtime, makes no external calls, enables no public-query fanout, performs no downloads/file retrieval/mirroring, and mutates no source cache, evidence ledger, candidate index, public/local/master index, telemetry, or credentials. Future work is blocked on official source policy review, User-Agent/contact policy, rate limits, timeouts, retry/backoff, circuit breakers, cache-first source cache output, and evidence ledger attribution.

This cross-reference keeps `docs/reference/SOURCE_SYNC_WORKER_CONTRACT.md` aligned with the source-ingestion boundary: IA metadata may become future reviewed cache/evidence input, never direct truth or live public search fanout.

## P72 Wayback/CDX/Memento Connector Approval Pack v0

P72 defines a future availability/capture-metadata-only Wayback/CDX/Memento connector approval pack. The connector is not implemented, no external calls are made, public queries do not fan out to Wayback/CDX/Memento, arbitrary URL fetch is forbidden, archived content fetch/capture replay/WARC download are forbidden, and future outputs must be cache-first/evidence-first after URI privacy review and approval.

<!-- P73-GITHUB-RELEASES-CONNECTOR-APPROVAL-START -->
## P73 GitHub Releases Connector Approval Pack v0

P73 defines a future release-metadata-only GitHub Releases connector approval pack. The live connector is not implemented, no external calls are made, no GitHub API calls are made, public queries do not fan out to GitHub, arbitrary repository fetch is forbidden, repository clone is forbidden, release asset download is forbidden, source archive download is forbidden, raw file/blob/tree fetch is forbidden, scraping/crawling is forbidden, token use is not allowed now, and future outputs must be cache-first/evidence-first after repository identity review and approval.

<!-- P74-PYPI-METADATA-CONNECTOR-APPROVAL-START -->
## P74 PyPI Metadata Connector Approval Pack v0

P74 adds an approval-only, package metadata-only PyPI connector pack. It adds no live PyPI connector runtime, no external calls, no PyPI API calls, no package metadata fetch, no release fetch, no wheel/sdist/package file download, no package install, no dependency resolution, no package archive inspection, no public-query fanout, no telemetry, no credentials or tokens, and no source cache/evidence ledger/candidate/index mutation. Package identity review, dependency metadata caution, source policy review, User-Agent/contact, token policy, rate limits, timeouts, retry/backoff, circuit breaker, cache-first output, and evidence attribution remain approval gates.

<!-- P80-SOURCE-PAGE-CONTRACT-START -->
## P80 Source Page Contract v0

Source Page Contract v0 is contract-only and evidence-first. It defines future public source pages for source identity, status, coverage, connector posture, source policy gates, source cache/evidence posture, public search projection, query-intelligence projection, limitations, provenance caution, and rights/risk posture.

Boundary notes:

- No runtime source routes, database, persistent source-page store, connector runtime, source sync runtime, source cache runtime, evidence ledger runtime, candidate promotion, public-index mutation, local-index mutation, master-index mutation, live source fanout, downloads, mirrors, installs, execution, uploads, telemetry, accounts, rights clearance, malware safety claim, or authoritative source trust claim are added.
- Public search may reference source page links or source badges only after a future governed integration; P80 does not mutate public search result cards or the public index.
- Source pages explain source posture and limitations; they are not source API proxies, scrapers, crawlers, download pages, mirrors, or connector health dashboards.

<!-- P81-COMPARISON-PAGE-CONTRACT-START -->
## P81 Comparison Page Contract v0

Comparison Page Contract v0 is contract-only and evidence-first. It defines future public comparison pages for subjects, criteria, matrices, identity/version/representation/source/evidence/compatibility/action comparisons, conflict preservation, scoped gaps, and future result-card/object/source projections.

Boundary notes:

- No runtime comparison pages, database, persistent comparison-page store, connector runtime, source sync runtime, source cache runtime, evidence ledger runtime, candidate promotion, public-index mutation, local-index mutation, master-index mutation, live source fanout, downloads, installs, execution, uploads, telemetry, accounts, rights clearance, malware safety claim, authoritative source trust claim, or winner without evidence are added.
- Public search may reference comparison links only after a future governed integration; P81 does not mutate public search result cards or the public index.
- Comparison pages explain evidence-backed similarity, difference, conflict, and gaps; they are not ranking authority, candidate promotion, source API proxies, download pages, installer pages, or production comparison services.
