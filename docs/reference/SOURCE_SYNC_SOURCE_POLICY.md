# Source Sync Source Policy

Source sync source policy requires no public-query fanout, no arbitrary URL fetch, no downloads, no uploads, no installs, no execution, no credentials in examples, no raw payload dumps, cache-first handling, evidence attribution, source terms review, robots or source policy review, descriptive User-Agent policy, rate limits, timeouts, circuit breakers, and rights/risk review.

P69 does not configure credentials, contact emails, source-specific User-Agent values, live source access, source cache runtime, evidence ledger runtime, or production operations. Approval packs must define source-specific policy before future connectors can run.

## P70 Cache And Ledger Policy

Future source cache and evidence ledger outputs must preserve source policy, freshness, provenance, fixity, privacy, rights/risk, and evidence attribution. No public-query fanout, arbitrary URL cache, raw payload store, private data store, executable payload store, or current mutation is allowed.

## P71 Internet Archive Metadata Connector Approval

`docs/reference/INTERNET_ARCHIVE_METADATA_CONNECTOR_APPROVAL.md` defines an approval-only, metadata-only future Internet Archive connector pack. It is not runtime, makes no external calls, enables no public-query fanout, performs no downloads/file retrieval/mirroring, and mutates no source cache, evidence ledger, candidate index, public/local/master index, telemetry, or credentials. Future work is blocked on official source policy review, User-Agent/contact policy, rate limits, timeouts, retry/backoff, circuit breakers, cache-first source cache output, and evidence ledger attribution.

This cross-reference keeps `docs/reference/SOURCE_SYNC_SOURCE_POLICY.md` aligned with the source-ingestion boundary: IA metadata may become future reviewed cache/evidence input, never direct truth or live public search fanout.

## P72 Wayback/CDX/Memento Connector Approval Pack v0

P72 defines a future availability/capture-metadata-only Wayback/CDX/Memento connector approval pack. The connector is not implemented, no external calls are made, public queries do not fan out to Wayback/CDX/Memento, arbitrary URL fetch is forbidden, archived content fetch/capture replay/WARC download are forbidden, and future outputs must be cache-first/evidence-first after URI privacy review and approval.

<!-- P73-GITHUB-RELEASES-CONNECTOR-APPROVAL-START -->
## P73 GitHub Releases Connector Approval Pack v0

P73 defines a future release-metadata-only GitHub Releases connector approval pack. The live connector is not implemented, no external calls are made, no GitHub API calls are made, public queries do not fan out to GitHub, arbitrary repository fetch is forbidden, repository clone is forbidden, release asset download is forbidden, source archive download is forbidden, raw file/blob/tree fetch is forbidden, scraping/crawling is forbidden, token use is not allowed now, and future outputs must be cache-first/evidence-first after repository identity review and approval.

<!-- P74-PYPI-METADATA-CONNECTOR-APPROVAL-START -->
## P74 PyPI Metadata Connector Approval Pack v0

P74 adds an approval-only, package metadata-only PyPI connector pack. It adds no live PyPI connector runtime, no external calls, no PyPI API calls, no package metadata fetch, no release fetch, no wheel/sdist/package file download, no package install, no dependency resolution, no package archive inspection, no public-query fanout, no telemetry, no credentials or tokens, and no source cache/evidence ledger/candidate/index mutation. Package identity review, dependency metadata caution, source policy review, User-Agent/contact, token policy, rate limits, timeouts, retry/backoff, circuit breaker, cache-first output, and evidence attribution remain approval gates.
