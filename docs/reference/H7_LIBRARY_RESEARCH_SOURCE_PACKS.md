# H7 Library Research Source Packs

H7 defines thirty library, cultural, book, research, repository, dataset, and patent metadata sources as Source OS policy records. These records are planning artifacts for fixture replay and review gates, not runtime connectors.

## Current Boundary

H7-BUNDLE-01 is policy-pack-only. It does not enable live access, API queries,
OAI-PMH harvests, DOI/ISBN/patent queries, full-text fetches, downloads, IIIF
fetches, scraping, crawling, restricted-source access, source sync, public index
mutation, master index mutation, or truth acceptance.

## Validation

- `python scripts/validate_h7_library_research_policy_packs.py`
- `python scripts/summarize_h7_library_research_sources.py --check`
