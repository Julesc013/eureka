# H7 Bibliographic Identity Policy

Bibliographic identity candidates include title, contributors, publisher, dates, edition, ISBN/ISSN/OCLC/LCCN and catalog locator fields. They require review and are not accepted bibliographic truth.

## Current Boundary

H7-BUNDLE-01 is policy-pack-only. It does not enable live access, API queries,
OAI-PMH harvests, DOI/ISBN/patent queries, full-text fetches, downloads, IIIF
fetches, scraping, crawling, restricted-source access, source sync, public index
mutation, master index mutation, or truth acceptance.

## Validation
