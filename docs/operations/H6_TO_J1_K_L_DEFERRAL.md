# H6 To J1/K/L Deferral

J1 risky actions, K semantic/AI, and L wider clients remain deferred unless their gates are explicitly opened. H6 does not authorize fetch, crawl, download, acquisition, sensitive-source access, model/provider calls, or deployment.

No-goals: no new live calls, CDX/Memento queries, WARC/WACZ fetches, archived/live page fetches, media/transcript/newspaper/public-document downloads, scraping, crawling, browser automation, bypass, sensitive-source access, source sync, public/master index mutation, production claims, or truth acceptance.

Fixture/live/blocked handling: committed fixtures and replay outputs may create review seeds; blocked live-probe reports are policy evidence only; approved live-probe outputs, if present in a future task, remain candidates/previews until reviewed.
