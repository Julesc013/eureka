## Risk Summary

- This is the first real target-repo import; target adaptation may expose pack assumptions that were invisible inside AIDE.
- Eureka-specific golden tasks now exist and pass, but they prove deterministic governance readiness rather than arbitrary product implementation quality.
- No provider routing, Gateway forwarding, model-call enforcement, or autonomous loop is enabled in this pilot.
- Token measurement uses the approximate `chars / 4` method, not an exact tokenizer or provider billing integration.
- Imported pack commands may need upstream synchronization after the Eureka-local selftest fallback repair; this target task does not mutate the AIDE source repo.
- Eureka-local AIDE Lite `test`, `selftest`, and `eval run` pass after target repairs, but broad product automation is still deferred.
- Final handoff is repo-local and reviewable, but future agents still need to respect the staged queue and avoid treating AIDE metadata as product truth.
- `EUREKA-CONVERGE-01` promotes Track A as the next execution spine. `TRACK-A-01` should remain contract/docs/audit scoped and must not change runtime behavior.

## Non-Goals / Scope Guard

- Gateway
- provider calls
- model routing
- Runtime/Service/Commander/UI/Mobile
- MCP/A2A
- automatic model calls or repair

## Reviewer Instructions

- Review only this packet and the referenced evidence when needed.
- Do not request full chat history unless the packet is insufficient to judge correctness.
- Do not re-summarize the whole project.
- Do not reward scope creep.
- Do not approve missing validation as a pass.
- Required output sections: `DECISION`, `REASONS`, `REQUIRED_FIXES`, `OPTIONAL_NOTES`, `NEXT_PHASE`.
- Decision policy: `.aide/verification/review-decision-policy.yaml`.
