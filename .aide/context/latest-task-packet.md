# AIDE Latest Task Packet

## PHASE

UNSPECIFIED - H6-BUNDLE-02 - Web archive, news, and event fixture runtimes and normalizers. Use committed public-safe fixtures only. Do not authorize live source calls, CDX/Memento queries, WARC/WACZ fetches, archived page fetches, media downloads, transcripts, newspaper pages, public document fetches, scraping, crawling, browser automation, bypass, source sync, public/master index mutation, or truth acceptance. HUMAN-OBS-REVIEW-01 remains a parallel side-lane.

## GOAL

H6-BUNDLE-02 - Web archive, news, and event fixture runtimes and normalizers. Use committed public-safe fixtures only. Do not authorize live source calls, CDX/Memento queries, WARC/WACZ fetches, archived page fetches, media downloads, transcripts, newspaper pages, public document fetches, scraping, crawling, browser automation, bypass, source sync, public/master index mutation, or truth acceptance. HUMAN-OBS-REVIEW-01 remains a parallel side-lane.

## WHY

Continue AIDE token survival for the Eureka target repo by using repo-local context refs, compact objectives, deterministic validation, and evidence packets instead of long chat history.

## CONTEXT_REFS

- `.aide/memory/project-state.md`
- `.aide/memory/decisions.md`
- `.aide/memory/open-risks.md`
- `.aide/context/repo-snapshot.json` (present)

- `.aide/policies/cache.yaml`
- `.aide/policies/local-state.yaml`

## ALLOWED_PATHS

- `<fill from the next reviewed queue packet>`
- `.aide/context/**`
- `.aide/queue/unspecified-*` if this task becomes a queue item
- root docs only when behavior or documentation links change

## FORBIDDEN_PATHS

- `.git/**`
- `.env`
- `secrets/**`
- `.aide.local/**`
- `runtime/**`
- `contracts/**`
- `surfaces/**`
- `site/**`
- `native/**`
- `crates/**`
- `connectors/**`
- `packaging/**`
- `third_party/**`
- raw provider credentials, API keys, local caches, raw prompt logs
- Gateway, provider, Runtime, Service, Commander, Mobile, MCP/A2A, host, or app-surface implementation paths unless the queue packet explicitly authorizes them

## IMPLEMENTATION

- Read the queue packet and relevant repo refs first.
- Keep changes inside the allowed paths.
- Make the smallest coherent diff that satisfies acceptance.
- Preserve generated/manual boundaries.
- Do not inline whole source files unless exact contents are required.
- Use exact refs such as `path#Lstart-Lend` when file details are load-bearing.

## VALIDATION

- `py -3 .aide/scripts/aide_lite.py doctor`
- `py -3 .aide/scripts/aide_lite.py validate`
- `py -3 .aide/scripts/aide_lite.py index`
- `py -3 .aide/scripts/aide_lite.py context`
- `py -3 .aide/scripts/aide_lite.py verify`
- `py -3 .aide/scripts/aide_lite.py review-pack`
- `py -3 .aide/scripts/aide_lite.py eval run`
- `py -3 .aide/scripts/aide_lite.py route explain`
- `py -3 .aide/scripts/aide_lite.py test`
- `py -3 .aide/scripts/aide_lite.py selftest`
- `py -3 scripts/check_architecture_boundaries.py`
- `py -3 scripts/aide validate`
- `git diff --check`

## COMMITS

- Commit coherent subdeliverables with verbose bodies.
- Stop at review gates.

## EVIDENCE

- changed files
- validation commands and results
- verifier result
- review packet path and result when review-pack is available
- advisory route decision path and result when Q17 routing is available
- compact packet size and budget status
- unresolved risks and deferrals

## NON_GOALS

- No Eureka product behavior change, Gateway, provider calls, live model routing, local model setup, exact tokenizer, provider billing ledger, Runtime, Service, Commander, Mobile, MCP/A2A, UI, host/app implementation, or autonomous loop unless this packet is superseded by a reviewed queue item that explicitly authorizes it.

## ACCEPTANCE

- Task-specific acceptance criteria are met.
- Validation is run and recorded.
- Evidence is written.
- No secrets, raw prompt logs, local caches, or `.aide.local` contents are committed.

## OUTPUT_SCHEMA

Return a compact final report with `STATUS`, `SUMMARY`, `COMMITS`, `CHANGED_FILES`, `VALIDATION`, route/verifier/token results, `RISKS`, and `NEXT`.
Include the verifier result when Q12 verifier behavior is available.

## TOKEN_ESTIMATE

- method: chars / 4, rounded up
- chars: 4847
- approx_tokens: 1212
- budget_status: PASS
- warnings:
  - none
- formal ledger: `.aide/reports/token-ledger.jsonl`
